        <li>Developed the use of Consul for DNS-based service discovery and as a distributed key-value store for easily updating configuration information without a complete rebuild.</li>
        <li>Improved and maintained the large in-house Rails application for infrastructure automation.</li>
        <li>Created a set of microservices to respond instantly to AWS events and feed a dashboard to give our Tier 2 team actionable data in realtime.</li>

        <li>Worked on writing the Liability Management System, a Java Amazon service to control transferring of moneys to users' bank accounts.  Wrote a component which enabled us to receive credit card data with the newer Coral API protocol, interfacing directly with Amazon's older HTTP-based firewall-level credit card encryption service.</li>
        <li>Worked on other components of the distributed job queuing system, which sent job data onto SQS, and broadcasted via SNS to the set of app servers to execute.</li>

        <li>One of two senior technical leads building out the backend systems and merchant-facing web application of a point-of-sale solution.</li>
        <li>Successfully led a team effort to wrap a large legacy codebase in 100% tests with Red/Green continuous integration monitor always visible to the engineering team.  This enabled us to refactor and improve the application, leading to substantially fewer bugs.</li>
        <li>We were able to foster an environment of greater mentorship and code quality by helping implement a code-review system where myself and the other senior dev reviewed all of the code via Pull Requests.</li>
        <li>Doubled the throughput of our transaction ingestion stream from our Java-based transaction processing server by optimizing the table structure and utilizing actor-based concurrency. This addressed Amazon's last remaining issue with us, allowed us to pass their stress test, and clinched the acquisition of the company.</li>
        <li>Rewrote the code calculating transaction fees and depositing money into customers' bank accounts.</li>
        <li>Architected and wrote the Backbone.js / Coffeescript application for our merchants to access and update their menus and PoS products, and the merchant analytics reporting application.

        <li>Ensuring code quality in all parts of the application.</li>
        <li>Wrote a system for identifying keywords and concepts in a dream, and then generating a weighted tag-cloud for it.  One could traverse the tag cloud to find other dreams about similar topics.</li>
        <li>Wrote a DSL to interface with ImageMagick to dynamically resize uploaded images according to the exact specifications of our user interface artist.</li>
        <li>Dramatically reduced page load time by implementing HTTP streaming (nginx and unicorn), embedding small icons in a separate stylesheet data-uri encoded, and aggressively caching expensive template renders in memcache.  Cache expiry was accomplished by naming the keys with the name and id of the major model objects necessary to render a template, and their updated_at timestamp.</li>
