        <li>As part of a major credit card company's innovation budget, co-architected and wrote a Slack chat-based bot in Node.js to dynamically form a legal association and distribute bitcoin blockchain-based cryptocurrency meta-tokens representing an equity allocation / profit distribution rights in the association.  Set up Ethereum and began writing smart contracts to implement automated income distribution to token holders.</li>
        <li>Prototyped on behalf of one of the inventors of SSL a concept for revocable self-signed certificates utilizing metadata in Bitcoin transactions to verify authenticity and viability of a self-signed certificate.</li>
        <li>Took part in a conference, "Rebooting the Web of Trust", to co-author a whitepaper on implementing a modern-day web-of-trust for PGP's 25th anniversary.</li>
        <li>Wrote an automobile fleet management application, interfaced with Edmunds and Kelly Bluebook APIs using Rails.  Wrote a subscription-based social network web application in Rails.</li>

        <li>Developing the distributed systems and services for Amazon Local Commerce, Amazon's point-of-sale solution.</li>
        <li>Worked on writing the Liability Management System, a Java Amazon Coral service to control transferring of moneys to users' bank accounts.  Successfully enabled us to use the newer Coral API protocol by writing a component that interfaced with Amazon's older HTTP-based firewall-level encryption service, since Amazon's newer Coral-based encryption service was not yet ready for production applications. Also worked on other components which sent job execution data onto SQS (simple queue service), and broadcast via SNS (push notification service) to the bank of servers to execute further processes.</li>
        <li>In order to comply with internal security requirements, wrote AWS DynamoDB security rules, automated Hadoop analytics cluster spin up in AWS and assigned a whitelisted internal elastic IP address automatically.</li>
        <li>Helped the web team speed their development iteration from ~10 minutes compilation time per change, to immediately seeing changes by developing a package based on the Rails asset pipeline that served the assets dynamically in development and compiled and minified the assets in production.</li>
        <li>Helped write EMR (Elastic MapReduce) code to pre-calculate aggregate user sales data and other analytics.</li>
      </ul>

        <li>One of two senior technical leads building out the backend systems and merchant-facing web application of a point-of-sale solution.</li>
        <li>Successfully, with the help of the other senior engineer, wrapped a legacy codebase in 100% tests with Red/Green continuous integration monitor always visible to the engineers.  This enabled us to refactor and improve the application, leading to substantially fewer bugs.</li>
        <li>We were able to foster an environment of greater mentorship and code quality by helping implement a code-review system where myself and the other senior dev reviewed all of the code submitted by more junior engineers, and each other's code.</li>
        <li>Eliminated angry customer phone calls by rewriting the software that calculates transaction fees and deposits money into customers' bank accounts.</li>
        <li>Architected and wrote the Backbone.js / coffeescript application for our merchant-facing web applications, including the merchant analytics reporting portal.  Transitioned backend templates to haml-js, and wrote the RESTful JSON API endpoints for the application to synchronize its state.  </li>
        <li>Wrote APIs to interact with the mobile POS system.</li>

        <li>Trained a team of junior designers and programmers in using the modern state-of-the-art tools and methodologies in web application development, including git for distributed source control management, basic command-line usage, and setting up a local Rails development environment for efficient development.</li>
        <li>Wrote the backend of the application. Designed the DB schema, wrote the model logic.</li>
        <li>Overseeing and maintaining overall code quality in all parts of the application.</li>
